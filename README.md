## PDF on Submit

Generate a PDF on submit of Quotation, Sales Order, Sales Invoice, Delivery Note or [Dunning](https://github.com/alyf-de/dunning).
All can be turned off via `PDF on Submit Settings`.

### Install

```bash
cd frappe-bench
bench get-app https://github.com/tueit/pdf_on_submit.git
bench --site erp.my-company.com install-app pdf_on_submit
```

(Replace `erp.my-company.com` with your site name.)

For some reason, the `on_submit` trigger still runs before submission is complete. That's why there will be **DRAFT** printed on your documents. If you do not want this, got to Print Settings and uncheck `Always add "Draft" Heading for printing draft documents`.
